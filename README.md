Provides authentication services for Solidus, using the Devise gem.

## Usage

### Installation

Add solidus_auth_devise to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_auth_devise'
```

Then, run `bundle install`.

After that's done, you can install and run the necessary migrations, then seed the database:

```shell
bundle exec rake solidus_auth:install:migrations
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

#### Default Username/Password

As part of running the above installation steps, you will be asked to set an admin email/password combination. The default values are `admin@example.com` and `test123`, respectively.

#### Confirmable

To enable Devise's Confirmable module, which will send the user an email with a link to confirm their account, you must do the following:

* Add this line to an initializer in your Rails project (typically `config/initializers/spree.rb`):

```ruby
Spree::Auth::Config[:confirmable] = true
```

* Add a Devise initializer to your Rails project (typically `config/initializers/devise.rb`):

```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  # Required so users don't lose their carts when they need to confirm.
  config.allow_unconfirmed_access_for = 1.days

  # Add any other devise configurations here, as they will override the defaults provided by solidus_auth_devise.
end
```

### Using in an existing application

If you are installing Solidus inside of a host application in which you want your own permission setup, you can do this using the `register_ability` method.

First create your own CanCan Ability class following the CanCan documentation.

For example: `app/models/super_abilities.rb`

```ruby
class SuperAbilities
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize user
    if user.is? "Superman"
      can :stop, Bullet
    end
  end
end
```

Then register your class in your spree initializer: config/initializers/spree.rb

```ruby
Spree::Ability.register_ability(SuperAbilities)
```

Inside of your host application you can then use CanCan like you normally would.

```erb
<% if can? :stop Bullet %>
  ...
<% end %>
```

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'solidus_auth_devise/testing_support/factories'
```

Or, if you are using `FactoryBot.definition_file_paths`, you can load Solidus core
factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusAuthDevise::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```

### Releasing new versions
